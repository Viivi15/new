# How to Present HarshitOS 🎂

Your gift is ready! This is a complete, interactive "Operating System" designed just for Harshit.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Quickest Method**: Double-click `harshit_birthday.html` (Single file, no setup needed).
2. **Old Method**: Double-click `index.html` (Requires assets folder).

## 🚀 How to Run (Single File)
1. Navigate to the folder: `D:\recents\new`
2. Double-click on `harshit_birthday.html`.
3. The site will launch with all features embedded.

### 💌 Personalizing the Gift
This OS is built for Harshit, but you can add the final touches:
1. **Music**: Replace the default track with his favorite song. Find the line `<source src="...` and paste the link to his MP3.
2. **Photos**: To update the photos in the "Memories" app, find the `img src` tags in the `photos` app section and replace them with links to your own photos.




6. **Play the Games!**
    *   **Smash Bhindi**: Click the desktop icon `🔨`. Bhindis will pop up randomly. Smash them before they disappear!
    *   **Subway Station**: Click `🥪`. Select "Extra Cheese" (obviously) and click Order.
    *   **Speed Force**: Click `⚡`. Wait for the box to turn GREEN, then click FAST. It measures your reaction time.
    *   **Strength Meter**: Click `💪`. Hit the red button. Warning: Screen *might* crack (it's a prank!).
    *   **Nakhre Calc**: Click `🍼` to see today's sass level.

## 🚀 How to Run (Original)

## 📦 Making it Offline (Optional)
Currently, the website uses some online images (GIFs for the bears, wallpapers). If you want it to work perfectly without internet, you should download these files and save them in the `assets` folder:

1. **Wallpaper**:
   - Download a high-quality Husky/Snow image.
   - Save it as: `assets/images/husky-snow-4k.jpg`
   - Update `style.css` (line 22) if the name differs.

2. **Bear GIFs** (Milk & Mocha):
   - Find your favorite GIFs on Tenor/Pinterest.
   - Save them in `assets/gifs/`.
   - Update the `src` links in `script.js` or `index.html` to point to `assets/gifs/filename.gif`.

3. **Audio**:
   - Ensure `emotional-piano.mp3` is in `assets/audio/`.

## ✨ Features Included
- **Identity Card**: His profile as "World's Strongest".
- **The Letter**: Your heartfelt message (opens automatically).
- **Iron Gym**: A clicker game to lift weights.

- **Complaint Box**: A place to complain (spoiler: he deletes them).
