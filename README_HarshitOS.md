# How to Present HarshitOS 🎂

Your gift is ready! This is a complete, interactive "Operating System" designed just for Harshit.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Quickest Method**: Double-click `harshit_birthday.html` (Single file, no setup needed).
2. **Old Method**: Double-click `index.html` (Requires assets folder).

## 🚀 How to Run (Single File)
1. Navigate to the folder: `D:\recents\new`
2. Double-click on `harshit_birthday.html`.
3. The site will launch with all features embedded.

### 💌 Personalizing the Gift
This OS is built for Harshit, but you can add the final touches:
1. **Music**: Replace the default track with his favorite song. Find the line `<source src="...` and paste the link to his MP3.
2. **Photos**: To update the photos in the "Memories" app, find the `img src` tags in the `photos` app section and replace them with links to your own photos.
3. **API Key**: Don't forget to add your Gemini API Key for the smart features!

### 🤖 Setting up AI Features (Optional)
To make the "AI Assistant" and "Gen Script" work, you need a free key:
1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and get an API Key.
2. Right-click `harshit_birthday.html` -> Open with Notepad.
3. Find this line (near the bottom): `const apiKey = "";`
4. Paste your key inside the quotes: `const apiKey = "YOUR_KEY_HERE";`
5. Save and refresh the page!

6. **Play the Games!**
    *   **Smash Bhindi**: Click the desktop icon `🔨`. Bhindis will pop up randomly. Smash them before they disappear!

## 📦 Making it Offline (Optional)
Currently, the website uses some online images (GIFs for the bears, wallpapers). If you want it to work perfectly without internet, you should download these files and save them in the `assets` folder:

1. **Wallpaper**:
   - Download a high-quality Husky/Snow image.
   - Save it as: `assets/images/husky-snow-4k.jpg`
   - Update `style.css` (line 22) if the name differs.

2. **Bear GIFs** (Milk & Mocha):
   - Find your favorite GIFs on Tenor/Pinterest.
   - Save them in `assets/gifs/`.
   - Update the `src` links in `script.js` or `index.html` to point to `assets/gifs/filename.gif`.

3. **Audio**:
   - Ensure `emotional-piano.mp3` is in `assets/audio/`.
