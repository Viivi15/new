# How to Present HarshitOS 🎂

Your gift is ready! This is a complete, interactive "Operating System" designed just for Harshit.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Navigate to the folder: `D:\recents\new`
2. Double-click on **`new.html`**.
3. The site will launch with all features enabled.

## 📂 Project Structure
This project uses a modern multi-file structure for better organization:
- **`new.html`**: The main entry point (Launch this!).
- **`new.css`**: Core styling for the desktop and apps.
- **`settings.css`**: Styles for the settings menu.
- **`main.js`**: Recent logic, system functions, and app definitions.
- **`notDumb.js`**: Logic for the "Not Dumb" app.

### 💌 Personalizing the Gift
This OS is built for Harshit, but you can add final touches:
1. **Music**: Replace the default track with his favorite song. Open `new.html`, find the `<audio id="bg-music">` tag, and replace the `src` link.
2. **Photos**: To update the photos in the "Memories" app, open `main.js`, search for `vaultPhotos`, and replace the image URLs with your own.

## ✨ Features Included
- **Boot Sequence**: A cinematic startup sequence with a countdown.
- **The Letter**: A heartfelt message in the "Through My Eyes" app.
- **Rabbit Runner**: A custom game where he collects subs and avoids bhindi.
- **VoiceBox**: A virtual dictaphone with "evidence".
- **Not Dumb**: A specialized app proving he isn't dumb (mostly).
- **The Dynamic**: A status dashboard of your friendship.

Enjoy the celebration! 🎈
